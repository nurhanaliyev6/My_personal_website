                <p>As I said, I am planning studying in Taiwan. I researched a bit about there. Here is my findings.The Taiwanese hardware industry is profiting from rising vaccination rates in the USA and Europe, its main market for hand tools, as well as from the consequences of the China-US trade war. The exhibition company Kaigo, organisers of the Taiwan Hardware Show (THS), is therefore very optimistic about the trade fair, which is to also take place this year as the only international hardware exhibition in Taiwan, namely from 13 to 15 October 2021 in the Taichung International Exhibition Hall again. The fair will be held once more in conjunction with iMT, Taiwan Metal Materials and Precision Processing Equipment Exhibition.</p>
